##  Configuring Eclipse Tools & Environment Setup

Eclipse was widely used for Android development before Android Studio. If you need to set it up for legacy projects, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Install Eclipse IDE**
1. Download **Eclipse IDE for Java Developers** from [Eclipse official site](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
2. Install it by extracting the downloaded package and running the executable.

### **Step 2: Install Android Development Tools (ADT) Plugin**
1. Open Eclipse and navigate to **Help** â†’ **Eclipse Marketplace**.
2. Search for **ADT Plugin**.
3. Click **Install**, accept the terms, and restart Eclipse.

### **Step 3: Configure Android SDK in Eclipse**
1. Download the **Android SDK** from [Android Developer Site](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads).
2. Extract it and note the installation path.
3. In Eclipse, go to **Window** â†’ **Preferences** â†’ **Android**.
4. Set the SDK Location to the extracted folder.

### **Troubleshooting Plugin Issues**
- If the ADT Plugin is not showing, reinstall it from **Eclipse Marketplace**.
- If Eclipse cannot detect the SDK, check the SDK path under **Preferences > Android**.

##  Installing Android SDK

### **Step 1: Download and Install SDK**
1. Download the **Android SDK Command Line Tools** from [SDK Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads).
2. Extract the files and move them to a convenient location (e.g., `C:\Android\SDK` on Windows or `~/Android/Sdk` on macOS/Linux).
3. Add the SDK path to the system environment variables.

### **Step 2: Install Essential SDK Packages**
Run the following command in the terminal to install required packages:
```sh
sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0"
```
- **`platform-tools`**: Includes ADB, Fastboot, etc.
- **`platforms;android-34`**: Required for compiling apps.
- **`build-tools;34.0.0`**: Necessary for building APKs.
